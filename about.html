            <h2>The Store</h2>
            <p>Looks like no one is watching the store at this moment, but i installed a sneaky cctv camera with alarm and notifies the app whenever there is detected motion.
                it already caught few hooligans on the spot. It is a really good deterrent for those people with no good intentions.
